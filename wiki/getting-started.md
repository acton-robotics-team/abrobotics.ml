# Getting Started

To get started with coding our robot, you first need to setup the repository on your machine.

## Setting up Android Studio

Android Studio is the IDE we use for developing as the phones. It's a pretty big IDE, so recommend you come with this already installed. You can install it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Android studio comes packaged with the Android SDK and other necessary dependencies. You _do not_ need to separately install Java.

## Setting up Git

Please refer to our git guide [here](https://abrobotics.ml/wiki/mdwiki.html#!basics-of-git.md).

## Cloning our repository
